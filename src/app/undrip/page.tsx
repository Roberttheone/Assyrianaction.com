        The UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) sets minimum standards for the survival, dignity, and well-being of Indigenous peoples worldwide.
        While it does not list specific groups by name, its principles apply broadly—covering self-determination, cultural preservation, language, and ties to ancestral lands.
